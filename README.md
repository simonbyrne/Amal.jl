Amal, a pure Julia math library *(a work in progress)*

With support for `Float16`, `Float32`, and `Float64` types. In the future we plan support for `Float80` and `Float128` types (when they become available in Julia).


Amal is an amalgamation of several open source math libraries, including SLEEF, Cephes, and Musl.

The Amal library principles include: avoid expensive branches and to avoid table look ups. As this library develops these guiding principles may adapt to meet different critera and needs of the Julia community.




## Installation


We recommend running julia with `-O3` for maximal performance using `Amal.jl` and to also build a custom system image by running
```julia
julia> is_windows() && (Pkg.add("WinRPM"); using WinRPM; WinRPM.install("gcc"))
julia> include(joinpath(dirname(JULIA_HOME),"share","julia","build_sysimg.jl"))
julia> build_sysimg(force=true)
```
and then to restart `julia`; this will ensure you are taking full advantage of hardware [FMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set)  if your CPU supports it.

## Usage


The exported functions presently include
```julia
exp, exp2
```
More function to come in the near future. 



To use  `Amal.jl`
```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaMath/Amal.jl.git")

julia> using Amal

julia> Amal.exp(2.0)
